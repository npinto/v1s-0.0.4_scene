This set of python scripts have successfuly been tested under GNU/Linux and 
Mac OS X. 

You will need the following open source python libaries:
- numpy (tested with version 1.0.1) 
- scipy (tested with version 0.5.2)
- PyML (tested with version 0.6.11 and 0.7.0)
- Python Imaging Library (tested with version 1.1.5)

Example of use:

# Download Caltech 101 Dataset
wget http://www.vision.caltech.edu/Image_Datasets/Caltech101/\
101_ObjectCategories.tar.gz

# Extract archive content
tar xzvf 101_ObjectCategories.tar.gz -C /tmp

# Assess the performance of a simple V1-like model
python ./v1s_run.py params_simple.py /tmp/101_ObjectCategories      

# Assess the performance of a simple V1-like model + cheap tricks
python ./v1s_run.py params_simple_plus.py /tmp/101_ObjectCategories 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Known Issue:

Note that you may need a lot of memory to run the program. A MemoryError 
exception will be raised if your operating system can't allocate enough memory
(remember that one process cannot address more than 4GB on a 32bit system).
